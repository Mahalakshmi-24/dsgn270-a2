# Part 2: Hero Section Critique

## Website name: Shein
## url of the website: https://ca.shein.com/

### Website summary:
   
   * Shein is a international fashion e-commerce platform While the brand focuses 
     heavily on women's fashion, it does offer items for men, as well as home d√©cor, 
     shoes, and accessories. There is even a pet section which offers everything from 
     coats and hats to plush toys and leashes.The shein cloths are mostly cheapest in 
     price.

### Call-to-Action Critique:

   * We can see SALE word in entire page and if we try to move any page of this 
     website we can see OFFER word anywhere.

   * In this website allows user to see and buy offers provided by that website.
